You are trying to describe the following RDF graph in plain English.

Here is the the RDF graph:
```
${memory}
```

Describe the RDF graph in one paragraph and make sure to follow these rules:
- FOCUS on the telling a story about the who, what, where, how, etc.
- LEAVE OUT anything not explicitly defined, do not make assumptions.
- DO NOT describe the RDF graph schema and DO NOT mention the RDF graph at all.
- If the RDF graph is empty then just return that there are currently no stored memory.
- Make sure to use plain and simple English.
