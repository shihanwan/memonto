You are a software engineer tasked to fix the following script that adds the following edges to an rdflib graph in Python.

Given the following error when running the previous script:
```
${error}
```

And the following script to add newly extract information:
```
${script}
```

From the following user message:
```
${user_message}
```

Onto to the following ontology:
```
${ontology}
```

Fix the error and return a new Python script adhering to these rules:
- NEVER generate code that initializes new graphs, namespaces, classes, properties, etc.
- GENERATE Python code to add the triples with the relevant information assuming rdflib Graph `data` and the newly added namespaces already exists.
- GENERATE all necessary rdflib and rdflib.namespace imports for the code to run.
- If there are no relevant information then RETURN a print an empty string and nothing else.
- Please generate the code without using ``` or any other code formatting symbols. Return only plain text.
