You are a software engineer tasked to create a Python script to extract ALL POSSIBLE relevant information from a user message that maps to a predefined RDF ontology.

Given this RDF graph that defines our desired ontology and namespaces:
```
${ontology}
```

And this user message:
```
${user_message}
```

And these removed triples:
```
${updated_memory}
```

Analyze the user message to find AS MUCH new information AS POSSIBLE that could fit onto the above ontology while adhering to these rules:
- First find all the new information in the user message that maps onto BOTH the above ontology and ESPECIALLY the removed triples.
- Second apply the existing namespaces to the extracted information.
- Finally create the script that will add the extracted information to an rdflib graph called `data`.
- NEVER generate code that initializes new graphs, namespaces, classes, properties, etc.
- GENERATE Python code to add the triples with the relevant information assuming rdflib Graph `data` and the newly added namespaces already exists.
- GENERATE all necessary rdflib and rdflib.namespace imports for the code to run.
- If there are no relevant information then RETURN a print an empty string and nothing else.
- Please generate the code without using ``` or any other code formatting symbols. Return only plain text.
